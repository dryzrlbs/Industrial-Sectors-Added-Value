## The main purpose is to understand and visualize the change in the input usage origin and added value of the sectors over the years. Finally, to understand which sectors have the potential to be affected more by a global logistics crisis scenario using this data.

In this context:

1) to calculate the domestic input, foreign input and added value shares of the sectors,
2) to calculate the share of the foreign sector/household/government/investment outputs of the sectors in their total outputs,

Outputs: 4 .png images, 1 .csv file
